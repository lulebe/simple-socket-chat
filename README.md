# Installation
1. `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. (optional) adjust settings and secrets in `config.json`
3. `npm start` to start the server
4. the server runs (by default) on `localhost:3000`

### Note
Once you stop the server, all chat and user data is gone, so messages and accounts
will not be stored across restarts.
